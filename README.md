# Schedule-template
This is a template that I will begin to use everyday to track how my day is going. 
It is made entirely from scratch (the design aspect is not mine originally).
I made this with the idea of tracking my day like Benjamin Franklin did.
I felt that I needed to give my day more structure, because there are times throughout the day where I am not productive.
Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own project, or, use it as your own personal schedule tracker.
